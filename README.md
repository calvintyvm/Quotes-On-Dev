A WordPress site that fetches Developer quotes from a api and is displayed
on the screen everytime the button is clicked.

## What was used for this project

Javascript, Jquery, SASS, CSS, HTML and PHP

## What was troubling for me

What was troubling for me was getting the javascript and jquery working. The submit button was easy but
I had a small typo in the submit page which gave me this error

![Error](https://gyazo.com/0ab2372958d087153841f005e75d2b63)'

But it was because in my data, I gave the variables a different name and thus the system could not find it in the php
files as I've declared the variables there. After I found that error, I changed it and it worked.

## Others
For this project I also tried to take advantage of SASS as I did not in inhabitent. With it, I quickly found the true use of SASS and how easy it is to change things if you want to in the future.
